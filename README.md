# Z-score-in-statistics
The Z-score, also known as the standard score, tells us the deviation of a data point from the mean by expressing it in terms of standard deviations above or below the mean. It gives us an idea of how far a data point is from the mean. Hence, the Z-Score is measured in terms of standard deviation from the mean.
